# _WORLD CUP DATA_


### By _**Bri Chavez**_

#### _This Code takes a CSV, puts in BigQuery, transforms it with DBT, then off to Google Data Studio to make pretty interactive graphs_



## Description

_I took a csv from a kaggle dataset. Brought it into a pandas datafram to do some transformations and renaming. Then I sent it off to BigQuery to be Uploaded to DBT. Inside DBT, the data was transformed further to follow a snowflake style modeling system. Afterwards, it was brought into Google Data Studio to make crazy cool interactive maps following our dbt model. Feel free to explore the graph below to find out more in depth information on world cup teams and players._
